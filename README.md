# Intro2ML-Lab02-SoftmaxRegression
In this project, you will work on a Classification problem using the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits. The main objective is to implement and train a Softmax Regression model from scratch, analyze its performance, and build a simple application that can recognize handwritten digits based on your trained model.
